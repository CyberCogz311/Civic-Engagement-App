# Civic Engagement App

## Overview
This app is designed to empower individuals through civic engagement, body activity data tracking, and rewarding users with cryptocurrency. It combines AR, VR, and blockchain to create a system of self-governance and accountability. I would like the end product to be a way for people to have a direct form of communication between political activism, the government and the United States leaders, and the media. This will prevent the spread of disinformation and create a more authentic, stable, peaceful world.The idea is to attach Gamification to the political system incorporating AR/VR and Ethereum to motivate people to engage in constructive social and political ideological change.

Leveraging blockchain and decentralization, the app ensures transparency, security, and empowerment for its users, giving them control over their participation in political actions. A gamified task-reward system incentivizes users to contribute meaningfully by completing tasks, promoting positive political change, and ensuring accuracy in the information shared. By combining cutting-edge technologies and a focus on civic engagement, this app aims to revolutionize how people interact with political movements, encouraging more informed, organized, and peaceful participation in societal change.

## Core Features
- **AR/VR Integration**: Use Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality to track political actions and engage with events.
- **Body Activity Tracking**: Reward users with cryptocurrency for physical activity such as walking, exercising, or participating in events.
- **Blockchain**: Store data on the Ethereum blockchain and reward users based on activity and engagement.

## Technologies
- **Frontend**: React Native
- **Backend**: Node.js, MongoDB, Firebase
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Web3.js, IPFS
- **AR/VR**: ARKit/ARCore, Unity3D

## Code Examples

### Body Activity Tracker (React Native)
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Text, View, Button } from 'react-native';
import { accelerometer, setUpdateIntervalForType, SensorTypes } from 'react-native-sensors';

setUpdateIntervalForType(SensorTypes.accelerometer, 1000); // Update every second

export default function ActivityTracker() {
  const [movementData, setMovementData] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 });

  useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = accelerometer.subscribe(({ x, y, z }) => {
      setMovementData({ x, y, z });
    });

    return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
  }, []);

  const calculateActivityScore = () => {
    const activityScore = Math.abs(movementData.x) + Math.abs(movementData.y) + Math.abs(movementData.z);
    return activityScore;
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Body Activity Score: {calculateActivityScore()}</Text>
      <Button title="Submit Activity" onPress={() => { /* Submit to blockchain */ }} />
    </View>
  );
}
